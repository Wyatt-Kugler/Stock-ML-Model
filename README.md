This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict stock price behavior using historical price data and Reddit sentiment analysis. It supports both **regression** (predicting future prices) and **classification** (predicting price increase/decrease).

##  Features

-  Regression and classification tasks using XGBoost
-  Sentiment data from Reddit integrated with financial data
-  Custom feature engineering: momentum, moving averages, volatility, etc.
-  Rolling sentiment window aggregation (3d, 7d, 14d, 30d, 1yr)
-  Feature importance & correlation analysis
-  Imputation and encoding pipelines
-  Modular Python code structure for scalability
